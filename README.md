Resource Awareness Philly is a open-source project that started at the Code for Philly SustyHack2015 from 10/17/15 - 10/18/15 in Philly. 
The goals of the project are

1. To create a comprehensive data set for all services for the homeless in Philly.

2. Provide web service REST apis to access and update the data set so that clients (web/mobile) can be developed.

3. Build a responsive web application that users in Philly can access on public library computers etc. as well as by services providers on desktop and mobile devices.

4. Iterative UI Design based on the needs and feedback of the homeless.

5. Increase awareness among volunteers to learn more about education & career opportunities related to coding & technology.

The software prototype includes
1. Web client app
2. REST APIs to access & update the data set.
3. Philly Homeless Resources data set as a Google doc.
